When less data is required for accurate amount of data

Training set as well as Testing Set, which is Known as
underfitting. . 

Ieee. We sing values before training, Und it can
be prevented by varying subset data along with
We overfit the data. For Arriving +e model.

Bias and variance can be reduced by cleaning
